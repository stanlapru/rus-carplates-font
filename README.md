# Russian car plates font
This repository houses the files of the font based on glyphs found on license plates of the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, South Ossetia, Abkhazia and the former Soviet Union, as guided by the GOST-R-50557-93 standard.  

Glyphs were taken from existing sources on the internet, drawn upon the examples of Soviet or Kazakh license plates or created from scratch, thus, some of them may look imperfect. Feel free to open an issue or a pull request, for there is room for improvement.

Currently, the typeface features decimal numbers and English and Russian alphabets (small glyphs).
